# deadlocked

A fork of [avitran0/deadlocked](https://github.com/avitran0/deadlocked) with the unsafe memory-writing features removed.

The following features from the upstream project have been dropped because they write directly to game process memory:

- **No Flash** — overwrote the player pawn's flash alpha value in memory
- **No Smoke** — overwrote the smoke grenade's effect flag in memory
- **Change Smoke Color** — overwrote the smoke grenade's color value in memory

All other functionality (ESP, aimbot, triggerbot, bunnyhop, etc.) is retained.

## Setup

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/keijo0/deadlocked
cd deadlocked
./setup.sh
cargo run --release
```

See [os-setup.md](os-setup.md) for OS-specific setup instructions.
